- Include a clear description of the change and why it's needed
- Add tests for new functionality when possible
- Ensure `pnpm format-and-lint` passes (server)

## Architecture Notes

- **`graph-agent/`** is the AI orchestration core — changes here require extra care and thorough testing
- **`credits/`**, **`tos/`**, **`knowledge/`** are intentionally stubbed modules — do not delete them, only modify the stub behavior
- See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed architecture context

## Reporting Issues

- Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests
- See the [public label policy](docs/labels.md) for how maintainers classify issues and pull requests
- For security vulnerabilities, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
