  <strong>A mobile GUI agent framework for Android.</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
  OpenGUI helps AI agents see, understand, and operate Android app interfaces on real devices.
</p>

## Demo

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/assets/opengui-demo.gif" alt="OpenGUI mobile GUI agent demo" width="100%">
</p>

OpenGUI reads a real Android app UI, plans the next step, takes mobile actions, and returns structured results.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to try OpenGUI is to let Claude Code or Codex bootstrap it for you.

```text
Read ./skills/open-gui-bootstrap/SKILL.md and help me run OpenGUI. Only ask me for phone-side actions.
```

You will need:

- an Android phone or emulator
- USB debugging enabled
- AccessibilityService enabled
- model API keys for real task execution

OpenGUI will use the repository scripts to start the backend and install the Android client:

```bash
cd server
./start.sh
```

```bash
cd client
./start.sh
```

After the backend and Android client are running, send a first task:

```bash
cd server
pnpm opengui -- devices --json
pnpm opengui -- do "Observe the current Android screen and summarize what you see" --json
```

Manual setup guide: [`docs/get-started.md`](./docs/get-started.md).

## Recent Updates

- `[2026.5.16]` Added [Codex / Claude Code remote control](./docs/codex-remote-control.zh-CN.md) with a local REST API, `pnpm opengui -- ...` CLI, and the [`open-gui-remote-control`](./skills/open-gui-remote-control/SKILL.md) Skill for dispatching Android app tasks from coding agents.
- `[2026.5.9]` Added a [Discord IM channel](./docs/DISCORD.md) for remote Android task dispatch, including prefix commands, slash commands, allowlists, and guild-scoped command registration.
- `[2026.5.7]` Hardened local startup to avoid common PostgreSQL and Redis port conflicts during Docker-based backend setup.
- `[2026.5.1]` Improved backend onboarding with `.env.example`, startup checks, and graph-agent VLM environment configuration.

## What You Can Do with OpenGUI

OpenGUI provides an Android GUI agent stack for screen understanding, task planning, action execution, review, and recovery.

You can use the same repository in four practical ways:

- **Operate mainstream Android apps**: let AI handle mobile tasks inside X, Reddit, Hacker News, Telegram, WeChat, Weibo, Xiaohongshu, and other Android apps on a real phone.
- **Run shipped workflows**: the repository already includes a runnable backend, Android client, standby dispatch path, and a set of built-in task capabilities.
- **Let Claude or Codex bootstrap it for you**: point the model at [`skills/open-gui-bootstrap/SKILL.md`](./skills/open-gui-bootstrap/SKILL.md), describe the goal in plain language, and let it handle setup, build, install, and local debugging.
- **Let Codex control Android apps**: after OpenGUI is running, point Codex or Claude Code at [`skills/open-gui-remote-control/SKILL.md`](./skills/open-gui-remote-control/SKILL.md) to list devices, dispatch tasks, and track executions through the local CLI.
- **Operate phones as remote workers**: dispatch tasks through Feishu, Telegram, Discord, or REST API, keep devices on standby, and get structured results back from the backend.

- [Join the Discord community](https://discord.gg/pqHHw7XgJ3)

## Highlights

- **Built for long-running tasks**: OpenGUI is shaped for mobile workflows that may run for hours, with progress, review, and recovery kept inside the system.
- **Plan before action, summarize after execution**: before touching an app, OpenGUI breaks the goal into executable steps; after the run, it returns a structured summary of what happened, what worked, and what still needs attention.
- **The task can keep moving**: `Plan Supervisor` maintains task state and continuation, `Executor Graph` runs screenshot, vision, action, and call-user loops on top of live device state, and `Summarizer` closes the run with a structured result.
- **Phones can stay on standby**: the standby dispatch path lets devices receive remote work through Feishu, Telegram, Discord, or REST entry points.
- **Models can be assigned by role**: model routing separates planning from VLM execution so teams can choose providers by job.
- **The system is organized around real mobile workflows**: the graph, device execution path, and model split already exist in the source tree.

## Why OpenGUI Is Different

OpenGUI is built as a mobile operator system with explicit orchestration layers.

The source code currently exposes these pieces:

- `server/apps/backend/src/modules/graph-agent/graph/mobile-agent.graph.ts` for the main graph
- `server/apps/backend/src/modules/graph-agent/graph/executor.graph.ts` for the device-side execution loop
- `server/apps/backend/src/common/ws/standby.gateway.ts` for standby device dispatch
- `client/core_network/.../StandbySocketManager.kt` for persistent device standby connections
- `client/core_accessibility/.../GestureService.kt` for Android-side action execution

| Dimension | Typical phone-agent demo | OpenGUI |
|---|---|---|
| **Execution model** | Short interactive loop | Main graph plus executor subgraph |
| **Task state** | Usually local and session-bound | Task state managed in the backend graph |
| **Device path** | Often laptop-driven control | Android client with standby and execution sockets |
| **Model usage** | One model does most of the work | Planning and VLM paths can be split across providers |
| **Remote operation** | Optional add-on | Feishu, Telegram, Discord, REST API, and standby dispatch are built into the backend |

## Typical Use Cases

- Open X and collect recent posts for a topic
- Read and summarize Reddit or Hacker News threads on a live phone
- Trigger Android tasks remotely from Feishu, Telegram, Discord, or REST API
- Execute repetitive mobile workflows on Android devices
- Run long mobile workflows that need state, review, and recovery over many hours

## Current Limitations

- Requires an Android device or emulator.
- Requires USB debugging and AccessibilityService permissions.
- Execution quality depends on the model, app UI, network state, and task length.
- Not an always-on OS-level assistant yet; tasks are currently triggered manually or through configured dispatch channels.
- Long-running tasks are supported by the system design, but reliability still needs more real-world testing.
- More ready-to-run task examples and benchmarks are still needed.

## Roadmap

- Add a short demo video and more real app examples.
- Improve one-command local setup.
- Add more ready-to-run phone-use task templates.
- Improve execution recovery and failure reporting.
- Add benchmark tasks for Android GUI agent reliability.
- Expand docs for model configuration and cost-saving profiles.

## How to Use OpenGUI

### 1. With Claude or Codex

Start with [`skills/open-gui-bootstrap/SKILL.md`](./skills/open-gui-bootstrap/SKILL.md).

The intended flow is simple:

1. point Claude or Codex at the skill
2. describe the task in plain language
3. let the model handle backend bootstrap, APK build, install, and local debugging

It should only stop for:

- connecting a phone or starting an emulator
- approving USB debugging
- enabling AccessibilityService
- granting overlay or battery permissions
- providing API keys or bot credentials

After the backend and Android client are running, use [`skills/open-gui-remote-control/SKILL.md`](./skills/open-gui-remote-control/SKILL.md) to let Codex or Claude Code control the phone through the local CLI:

```bash
cd server
pnpm opengui -- devices --json
pnpm opengui -- do "Observe the current Android screen and summarize what you see" --json
pnpm opengui -- status <executionId> --json
```

Recommended profiles:

#### High-performance profile

Use the latest Claude Opus model family across planning, supervision, review, and vision when you want the strongest overall quality.

This is the easiest way to get the best execution quality, and it is the most expensive path.

#### Cost-saving mixed profile

Use **Qwen 3.6 Plus** for text-side roles such as Planner and Supervisor, and use **Doubao Pro** for the VLM side.

This usually preserves the overall system shape while lowering model cost by roughly **10x to 15x** compared with an all-Opus setup, depending on task length, screenshot volume, and token mix.

Recommended prompts:

#### Run it

```text
Read ./skills/open-gui-bootstrap/SKILL.md and help me run OpenGUI. Only ask me for phone-side actions.
```

#### Use Claude Opus everywhere

```text
Read ./skills/open-gui-bootstrap/SKILL.md and bootstrap OpenGUI with the latest Claude Opus model family for planning, supervision, review, and vision.
```

#### Use Qwen + Doubao to save cost

```text
Read ./skills/open-gui-bootstrap/SKILL.md and set up OpenGUI with Qwen 3.6 Plus for Planner and Supervisor, and Doubao Pro for VLM execution.
```

#### Use my own APIs

```text
Read ./skills/open-gui-bootstrap/SKILL.md and use my existing model APIs to get OpenGUI working.
```

### 2. Manual setup

Use the repository scripts directly:

```bash
cd server
./start.sh
```

```bash
cd client
./start.sh
```

- [docs/get-started.md](./docs/get-started.md)
- [server/start.sh](./server/start.sh)
- [client/start.sh](./client/start.sh)
- [server/apps/backend/README.md](./server/apps/backend/README.md)
- [docs/DISCORD.md](./docs/DISCORD.md)
- [client/README.md](./client/README.md)

### 3. Optional Discord remote control

Discord can be enabled as an optional IM channel. A Discord bot receives commands
such as `!opengui devices` or `!opengui do ...`, then the backend dispatches the
task to a standby Android phone and posts progress back to the same channel.

This is not required for local use. If `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is empty, the backend
starts normally and skips Discord.

Full setup guide: [docs/DISCORD.md](./docs/DISCORD.md).
